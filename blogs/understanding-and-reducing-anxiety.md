## Understanding and Reducing Anxiety

**Disclaimer:** I am not a doctor or therapist. All I am doing here is relaying information I have learned from talking with doctors and therapists as well as reading books that were written by doctors and therapists.

### Understanding anxiety

#### Physical symptoms
**The higher the levels of anxiety, the more likely there is to be physical symptoms associated with the anxiety.** Some people require more anxiety than others in order to experience physical symptoms. So if you take two anxious individuals, one who is experiencing physical symptoms and one who isn't, the person experiencing physical symptoms isn't necessarily the more nervous of the two.

The duration of anxiety also plays a role. **If you can go a long time with low anxiety, it will generally take a lot more anxiety for a longer period of time in order to experience physical symptoms.** If you frequently have anxiety, then it may feel like it doesn't take much in order to experience physical symptoms.

There are many different physical symptoms that you may get from having high levels anxiety. You might start out with a few symptoms on one day and then on another day have totally different physical symptoms. Or, you may even have one set of symptoms for a month, feel all better, and then a year or two later experience totally different physical symptoms when you get anxious again. So the physical symptoms you get won't necessarily be the same each time. And the symptoms you get might be a little different than what your friends get.

**Some potential physical symptoms include: headache, tightness in chest, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, diziness, diarrhea, sweating.**

#### Causes of anxiety
**Anxiety is caused by negative thoughts. You are telling yourself that something bad is going to happen.**

Let's say you are on an airplane and you have a fear of flying. Now all of a sudden, there is some turbulence and you say "We are going to crash!" **Your anxiety did not result from the turbulence. Your anxiety resulted from your negative thought about the turbulence.** Some others on the airplane did not immediately start to think about crashing and as a result did not feel nervous. 

**If you can change the way you think, then you can change the way you feel.**

#### Cognitive Distortions
**When people are anxious, their thinking tends to be very distorted and illogical. They tend to greatly exaggerate the amount of risk they are in.** Knowing this should help calm you down some when you feel anxious because this information should help you believe deep down that there is some change that you are exaggerating the amount of risk you are in. You may **feel** as if you are in a significant amount of danger but the amount of danger you are **actually** in is likely significantly less than the amount of danger you **feel** you are in.

List of distortions include:
1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: viewing things in terms of maximums or minimums with nothing in between
1. Overgeneralization: you view one negative occurrence as something that always happens
1. Discounting the positives: you tend to focus more on the negatives than the positives
1. Mind-Reading: you predict others are viewing you unfavorably when you don't know that for sure
1. Fortune-telling: you tell yourself something bad will happen when you don't know that for sure
1. Magnification or Minification: you blow things out of proportion
1. Should statements: you use should statements like shoulds, oughts, musts
1. Labeling: you label yourself as a loser
1. Blame: you blame yourself for something you had no control over or you blame others without looking at how you could have contributed

Most of the distortions are self explanatory but some need more explanation and will get their own section later on in this article. The important thing to know for now is that these distortions tend to be flaws in logic that commonly occur in thoughts when you are anxious.
