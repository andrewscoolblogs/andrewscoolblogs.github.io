## Understanding and Reducing Anxiety

**Disclaimer:** I am not a doctor or therapist. All I am doing here is relaying information I have learned from talking with doctors and therapists as well as reading books that were written by doctors and therapists.

### Understanding anxiety

#### Physical symptoms
The higher the levels of anxiety, the more likely there is to be physical symptoms associated with the anxiety. It's important to note that some people require more anxiety than others in order to experience physical symptoms. So if you take two anxious individuals, one who is experiencing physical symptoms and one who isn't, the person experiencing physical symptoms isn't necessarily the more nervous of the two.

The duration of anxiety also plays a role. If you can go a long time with low anxiety, it will generally take a lot more anxiety for a longer period of time in order to experience physical symptoms. If you frequently have anxiety, then it may feel like it doesn't take much in order to experience physical symptoms.

There are many different physical symptoms that you may get from having high levels anxiety. You might start out with a few symptoms on one day and then on another day have totally different physical symptoms. Or, you may even have one set of symptoms for a month, feel all better, and then a year or two later experience totally different physical symptoms when you get anxious again. So the physical symptoms you get won't necessarily be the same each time. And the symptoms you get might be a little different than what your friends get.

Some physical symptoms include: headache, tightness in chest, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, diziness, diarrhea, sweating.

#### Causes of anxiety
Anxiety is caused by negative thoughts. You are telling yourself that something bad is going to happen.
```
Let's say you are on an airplane and you have a fear of flying. Now all of a sudden, there is some turbulence and you say "We are going to crash!" Your anxiety did not result from the turbulence. There were some other passengers in the plane that did not have anxiety about the turbulence (and some other passengers probably did!). Your anxiety resulted from your negative thought about the turbulence.
