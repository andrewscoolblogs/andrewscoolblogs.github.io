## Understanding and Reducing Anxiety

**Disclaimer:** I am not a doctor or therapist. All I am doing here is relaying information I have learned from talking with doctors and therapists as well as reading books that were written by doctors and therapists.

### Understanding anxiety

#### Physical symptoms
**The higher the levels of anxiety, the more likely there is to be physical symptoms associated with the anxiety.** Some people require more anxiety than others in order to experience physical symptoms. So if you take two anxious individuals, one who is experiencing physical symptoms and one who isn't, the person experiencing physical symptoms isn't necessarily the more nervous of the two.

The duration of anxiety also plays a role. **If you can go a long time with low anxiety, it will generally take a lot more anxiety for a longer period of time in order to experience physical symptoms.** If you frequently have anxiety, then it may feel like it doesn't take much in order to experience physical symptoms.

There are many different physical symptoms that you may get from having high levels anxiety. You might start out with a few symptoms on one day and then on another day have totally different physical symptoms. Or, you may even have one set of symptoms for a month, feel all better, and then a year or two later experience totally different physical symptoms when you get anxious again. So the physical symptoms you get won't necessarily be the same each time. And the symptoms you get might be a little different than what your friends get.

**Some potential physical symptoms include: headache, tightness in chest, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, diziness, diarrhea, sweating.**

#### Causes of anxiety
**Anxiety is caused by negative thoughts. You are telling yourself that something bad is going to happen.**

Let's say you are on an airplane and you have a fear of flying. Now all of a sudden, there is some turbulence and you say "We are going to crash!" **Your anxiety did not result from the turbulence. Your anxiety resulted from your negative thought about the turbulence.** Some others on the airplane did not immediately start to think about crashing and as a result did not feel nervous. 

**If you can change the way you think, then you can change the way you feel.**

#### Cognitive Distortions
**When people are anxious, their thinking tends to be very distorted and illogical. They tend to greatly exaggerate the amount of risk they are in.** Knowing this should help calm you down some when you feel anxious because this information should help you believe deep down that there is some change that you are exaggerating the amount of risk you are in. You may **feel** as if you are in a significant amount of danger but the amount of danger you are **actually** in is likely significantly less than the amount of danger you **feel** you are in.

List of distortions include:
1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: viewing things in terms of maximums or minimums with nothing in between
1. Overgeneralization: you view one negative occurrence as something that always happens
1. Discounting the positives: you tend to focus more on the negatives than the positives
1. Mind-Reading: you predict others are viewing you unfavorably when you don't know that for sure
1. Fortune-telling: you tell yourself something bad will happen when you don't know that for sure
1. Magnification or Minification: you blow things out of proportion
1. Should statements: you use should statements like shoulds, oughts, musts
1. Labeling: you label yourself as a loser
1. Blame: you blame yourself for something you had no control over or you blame others without looking at how you could have contributed

Most of the distortions are self explanatory but some need more explanation and will get their own section later on in this article. The important thing to know for now is that these distortions tend to be flaws in logic that commonly occur in thoughts when you are anxious.

### Strategies for reducing anxiety

#### Distraction
We said earlier that anxiety is caused by our negative thoughts. We have a negative thought and thinking about that negative thought makes us nervous. **If we simply just don't think about that negative thought, our anxiety will lessen.** But it's not just as simple as "hey quit thinking about that." It is often easier if you can distract yourself by doing some sort of activity which may include playing a video game, going for a walk, playing a sport, watching TV, etc.

**Distraction is a good technique for short term anxiety relief but doesn't do anything for long term anxiety relief.** This is because distraction will get your mind off your nervous thought but once you are finished with your activity that distracted you from your nervous thought, what is to stop you from returning back to that nervous thought again?

#### Challenging negative thoughts
Now it's time for a technique that works well for the long term. It involves challenging your negative thoughts as much as possible. Suppose you have a negative thought that is making you anxious. You can do the following:
1. Write down your negative thought
1. Try to think about which distortions might be present in your thinking
1. Write down positive thoughts in response to your negative thoughts (reasons to not be as concerned as initially thought)

After this is done, you will want to start out by reviewing this writing multiple times per day. You can decrease how frequently you look at it after you have it better understood. The idea is that whenever this negative thought comes to mind, you immediately start to think about the corresponding positive thoughts. This will cause the negative thought to give you less anxiety than it originally did. In many cases, it will cause the negative thought to not even give you anxiety at all anymore. 

You want to write as many positive thoughts as possible. Any time that you think of another positive thought throughout the day, add it in there. The reason for having these positive thoughts written down is so that you don't have to worry about forgetting them when you are anxious. Imagine being anxious and trying to recall all 8 of the positive thoughts but you can only remember 2 of them. If they are all written down, then you are guaranteed to get all 8 of them every time you are anxious which will help with reducing anxiety.

Let's look at an example of challenging negative thoughts:

Negative thought: I have pain in my chest, is there something wrong with my heart?
Positive thoughts:
* I visited the doctor and they did many tests and found nothing wrong with my heart
* I was just able to run on a treadmill and set a personal record for the 1 mile run
* Pain decreased immensely during meditation
* If there was something wrong with my heart, I wouldn't have been able to set a personal record for the 1 mile run on a treadmill
* I am young and the doctor said the probability of young people having heart issues is very low
* My family has no history of heart issues
* Doctor told me there is no reason to be concerned about my heart at this time
* Above thoughts suggest there is nothing wrong with my heart and this is just anxiety related

#### Process vs outcome
Another technique for reducing anxiety is to think of things more in terms of the process than the outcome. Instead of thinking about the outcome such as "what if I get fired!" You can think of things in terms of the process such as "all I can do is give my best effort and whatever the result is, I can live with it." It's easy to get down on yourself and say things like "if I get fired, then that means that there's something wrong with me." That's not necessarily what that means. Management may not have known what they were doing. Your company could have been struggling financially. Maybe a robot took your job.

The point is, often times, we have little to no control over the outcome. Worrying about the outcome often causes more anxiety with less benefit. **So it is often more productive to think about the process since we have more control over the process and this mindset will lead to less anxiety. Just tell yourself that for any given situation, all you can do is give your best effort and whatever the result is, you can accept it because you did the best you could.** If anyone close to you informs you that they are disappointed in a result they have seen from you, then you can inform them that you gave your best effort. They should be understanding. If they are not, then do not feel bad because you did what you could and people really need to be understanding any time you give your best effort.

#### Reattribution
When something goes wrong, you may blame or label yourself which is something you want to avoid doing. You want to use reattribution when something goes wrong. With reattribution, you ask yourself: what caused this problem and how can I learn from it? 

You have a right to make mistakes and you have a right to learn from those mistakes.

#### Double standard technique
Often times when people are anxious, they tend to think about negative thoughts and discount the positives. When they go to a friend for help and a friend is giving them advice, the friend will typically only think about positive thoughts and will only feed positive thoughts.

So with the double standard technique, you imagine your friend being in the situation you are in and you imagine yourself giving advice to your friend. You would be imagining yourself feeding your friend positive thoughts.

#### What if technique
Take a negative thought. Now ask yourself, "if this negative thought was true, what is the worst that could happen?" After that, you ask yourself, "and if that happened, what is the worst that could happen from there?" You repeat this process until you can't go any farther.

Suppose you are walking around a grocery store but are having difficulty finding the item you are looking for. You are thinking of asking one of the grocery store employees for help but you are nervous about it because you are shy. The what if technique might look like this:
* I'm nervous about asking this employee about where an item is because he might pick up that I am shy and think that something is wrong with me.
* If the grocery store employee thinks that something is wrong with me, what is the worst that could happen? The employee might give me a weird look when I walk into the store next time.
* If the employee gives me a weird look when I walk into the store next time, what is the worst that could happen? I might take a less than optimal path within the grocery store to get my grocery.

With the what if technique you will sometimes see that the worst case scenario isn't as bad as you thought. Or even more common, you will see see that the worst case scenario is quite a bit less likely to occur. If you really dig through it with a friend or therapist, a lot of really unlikely assumptions have to hold true for the worst case scenario to hold up.

#### Image substitution
Suppose you are about to give a speech soon and you have public speaking anxiety. If you visualize yourself giving a bad speech, your anxiety levels will go up. This will make it more likely that you stutter throughout your speech. However, if you visualize yourself giving a good speech, this will decrease your anxiety and make it more likely for you to give a good speech. This is called image substitution. So any time you are nervous about something going wrong, try to visualize it going right. This reduces anxiety.

If you are nervous about flying on an airplane, visualize yourself flying on an airplane that lands safely. If you are nervous about your boss' opinion of your work, visualize your boss saying that your work looks great.

#### Memory rescripting
Depending on what has happened in your past, there may be previous memories that you have that make you feel uneasy. With memory rescripting, you simply just pretend that something different happened in the past when you try to visualize it. In other words, you use image substitution on the past instead of the future. Maybe a previous flight of yours had turbulence, which made you uneasey. Try to recall that flight but visualize it without having turbulence instead.

#### Acceptance
Sometimes you end up with a health issue later in life that is terminal. All you can do is just accept the situation and say "whatever happens, it's okay."

#### Meditation
I don't want to get into much detail on meditation in this blog post because meditation could easily quadrouple the length of this blog post. There are many different types of meditations and different types of meditations work better for different people. You just have to experiment and see what works for you. Meditation is just another tool for reducing anxiety. It takes a ton of practice before you start to see much benefit. There are many resources online if you want to learn more about meditation. I just want you to be aware that this option exists.

### Miscellaneous

#### Which technique is the best?
Dr. David Burns has indicated that there is no one size fits all technique that has worked for all of his clients. A technique that works on one client may not work on another aclient. In some cases, he will have to do more than 15 different techniques before finally finding a technique that works on a client. 

That being said, a few of these concepts appear to be generally more powerful. Challenging negative thoughts seems to generally be very powerful. Meditation does as well though meditation takes a lot longer than any other technique before any benefit is noticed.

#### Are these physical symptoms just anxiety related or is something actually wrong with me?
We listed out some potential physical symptoms that anxiety may cause above. However, just because you have those symptoms, doesn't mean that those symptoms came from anxiety. A symptom may have multiple causes. If you had high levels of anxiety around the time of these physical symptoms arising, that increases the chance that these symptoms being caused by anxiety but doesn't **guarantee** that these symptoms were caused by anxiety. You could just have had something bad happen to you plus anxiety at around the same time.

So it is always good to check with a medical professional to just confirm that these symptoms are anxiety related and there isn't actually anything wrong with you. If a doctor does tests on you and says that there is nothing wrong with you physically, then you need to just accept their word on it and trust that it must be anxiety related.

#### Relapse

#### Doctor vs Therapist
When it comes to anxiety, doctors seem to be the best at helping with the physical symptoms associated with anxiety. They can check to see if there is actually anything wrong with you physically or if it is just anxiety. They can also prescribe medications that can help with the physical symptoms you are experiencing from anxiety. They can also prescribe SSRIs for reducing anxiety. The downside of the SSRIs is they generally come with a few side effects.

While the doctor has the medical background, the therapist has the mental background. They understand the mental side of things very well. So if you want to reduce anxiety naturally, the therapist can help you do that. The therapist can help give you short term and long term strategies for reducing anxiety. They may be similar to the strategies you read in this blog post.

You should always aim to reduce anxiety through therapy. This may include seeing a therapist or may just be as simple as reading about cognitive behavioral therapy (which is where most information from this blog post came from). The reason why you should always aim to reduce anxiety this way is because it is side-effect free. If you want to use an SSRI in addition to this, then that is up to you and your doctor. But I see no reason to use an SSRI without using therapy. Either use therapy only or use therapy + SSRI. Don't use SSRI only. At least with therapy + SSRI you can be on a lower dosage of the SSRI than what you would have been on with SSRI only.
